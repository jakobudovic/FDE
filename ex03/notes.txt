time (for i in seq 1 1000; do echo $i; done;)
to make it executable
time (for i in $(seq 1 1000); do echo $i; done;)

$() expects a command and will execute it
$(()) is used to treat the expression as a mathematical/arithmetical one. i.e. $(($RANDOM+3))

equivalent to linux "cat /proc/cpuinfo" is on mac: "sysctl -a | grep machdep.cpu"

-march=native
flag puts in a bunch of flag specific to your platform
like includes, vectorisation imports

-3.3
high level languages are not platform specific

learn about topic of builds and how it is used to bypass curse of different cpu architectures.

4.1
check lvalues and rvalue

separator vs operator
separator: unsigned i = 0 , j = 0;
operator: ++i , j *= 2
calculates ++i, calculates j*=0 and return the latter expression result, from j*=0


4.3
Numeric promotion vs numeric conversion
promotion: when a + b, and one number is of lower datatype, it is promoted to the other (higher) one
conversion: 
int a = 5;
short b = a;

4.4
std::cout << std::hex << 234624 << std::dec << 123;
